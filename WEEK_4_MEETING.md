## Week 4

### What did the team do the past week?
* Aditya:

* Afreen: Added bricks design module which has been assigned.

* Neil: Added slider in game world and when ball hits slider it is returned. Slider movement with keyboard left, right button.

* Purvesh: Worked on adding the Mute/Un-mute functionality with appropriate images with turn on/off background sound of the game. Explored examples to figure out APIs for changing the ball velocity dynamically.

* Rahil: Implemented collision detection between object(bricks) and ball. When this happens object will be disappeared and player's score will be incremented accordingly. 

### What is the team going to do next week?
* Aditya:

* Afreen: Will be adding feature on the bricks breaking e.g. getting some power up on brick break which will be random.

* Neil: When ball hits particular group of bricks then slider size be changed. This functionality implementation.

* Purvesh: Will work on adding more functionalities related to the velocity of objects for the game.

* Rahil: On collision of particular type of the object with ball, some object will fall and on collection of that object by slider, property of ball or slider will be changed depending on the type of the falling object.

### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
* Aditya:

* Afreen: Team has blocker on requirement of design pattern.
