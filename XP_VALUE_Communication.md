Page includes information about how team is following Extreme Programming core value **'Communication'** over every week.

### Define Communication under consideration of XP? 

Extreme programming define Communication as vital process to be followed through out project development. Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

### Week 1

## MOM: Meeting 1

* Every team member has discussed about technical stack to meet project backlogs.
* Individuals has decided to do research on different technical stack to define suitability.
* Each team member has come up with their own idea for project and game engine to do research.
 

### Week 2

## MOM: Meeting 2

* We discussed about difficulties faced during past week while researching about different game engine.
* We discussed about demo created by Purvesh. He has explained about the challenges faced and knowledge required to to develop basic demo in progress of game development.
* Neil has communicated team about his challenges faced while research phase and reason behind choosing Phasor JS over openGL, webGL, HTML5, LWJGL.
* Team has decided on completing demos by this week.
* Team has communicated about deciding backlogs and finalizing project scope and structure.
* Team will be considering each members input for deciding game engine.


### Week 3

## MOM: Meeting 3

* We have decided on *'Phasor JS'* as final term project stack.
* Team has divided project into different models depending upon the game requirement and baclog priority.
* Everyone has distributed different modules of project to work on.

### Week 4

## MOM: Meeting 4

* Team has discussed about the progress and blockers.
* Each team is is progressing towards the achieving required goals.

### Week 5

## MOM: Meeting 5

* Team has discussed about code integration.
* Team decided a common coding structure for following in individual module, for acheiving simplicity while merging code.

### Week 6

## MOM: Meeting 6

* Team has decided to implement design pattern.
* Team has communicated about the individual choice about design pattern implementation.
