### XP Core Principle : Courage

### What is Courage in XP?
We will tell the truth about progress and estimates. 
We don’t document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed. 
We don’t fear anything because no one ever works alone.
We will adopt changes whenever they happen.

### How our team is following **Courage**?

### Week: 1

* In team’s first meeting, we firstly met with everyone’s own research work about project and requirement. Then we discussed various technologies and games which can be implemented in given time frame and stick with the intention of the project.
* The estimation of the research work about game and technology selection is around 2 weeks. 
* We have to create a prototype and try to run small model personally for final selection. 
* After 2 weeks of research work and in between meetings one of the efforts will be considered as final implementation approach for the project. 
* In between, if we face any difficulty related to integration or anything then the whole team will figure it out. We are exploring in Java libraries as well as Javascript libraries to make a game.

### Week: 2 

* Every team member comes up with their sample model of chosen web-based Game engine. 
* We have understood some of the game engines in Java but they are not feasible for the web-based game. That's why we switched mostly to the JavaScript-based game engine.   
* We plan to succeed so that we are now focusing on Phaser js mainly and understanding how actually to use it in our project.   
* Babylon js is very good for 3d gaming but the complexity of that game engine is relatively more than phaser js which is very good for 2d games.  
* As the focus of the project is mainly about design pattern implementation, we have the courage to go with the 2d game engine. This conclusion of game engine has been made after making a prototype of it. 

### Week: 3

* Whole team comes up with their understanding of web based game engine in Java or Javascript.
* How the game engine will be used with any web based game was main concern of discussion along with the features.
* Initiallly we were expecting that Java web based game engine will be better to implement a game, but after research we have courageously concluded that javascript game engine would be chosen especially Phase js.
* The documentation and its coding pattern with library in javascript will mostly suitable with design pattern which is main goal.
* As of now we have divided a game in some separate objects and its activities to work on and then merge it.
* We can adopt some changes afterwards as we start developing game in Phasor JS which is important skill of Courage.


### Week: 4

* Team has understood how PhasorJS works and which components and functionality needs to be implemented in a game. 
* We have selected some of the advanced techniques such that at some point of time dynamically size of slider and ball speed can be changed. 
* According to game implementation and correctness the functionality depends upon the javascript game engine. 
* This week basic game with major functionalities will be ready and along with that design pattern will be implemented. 
* All team members have chosen "Project Deliverable" from the given list.  
* Some of the features may be modified or added afterwards as per convenience.
