## Research status:  

- [x] **WebGL** - This API is for rendering advanced 2D/3D graphics without the help of other 3rd party plug-ins. Pure WebGL is like an assembly language of the web graphics programming, very useful to build something extremely custom but takes much more time for development. There are great alternatives like Three.js, phaser.io, playcanvas and many more to make something highly customized and fast in pure JavaScript. :x: 
- [x] **webRTC** - It is being used where we need real time communication in the form of audio or video. :x:
- [x] **WebSocket** - This API can be used to send message to the server and receive an event driven response without polling from the server. It is prefer for multiplayer gaming action and chat services. This can be implemented an extra feature for a game. It is not needed for a model development. :thought_balloon:

**Issue#8**: We will use 3rd party javascript plugins for rendering advanced 2D/3D graphics and we can use websocket API to provide an extra features. webRTC is not required for our project. **Status: Closed**
