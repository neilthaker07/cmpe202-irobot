## Week 2

### What did the team do the past week?
* Aditya: I have created a basic object in Babylon.js. I have tried to learn Babylon.js, But Babylon is a bit complex than phaser.js.

* Afreen: I have created basic functionality in greenfoot. Learned about greenfoot web deployment.  

* Neil: Created a prototype of a sample game in Phasor JS to understand how it works and what features it offers. Figured out that Javascript game engines are better than Java web-based game engines.

* Purvesh

* Rahil: I learned basics of babylon.js and created the very simple model of the pong game using babylon.js and came to know that it will be very difficult and complex to develop a game using Babylon.js.
