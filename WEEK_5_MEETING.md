### What did the team do the past week?

Aditya: Implement five patterns for stage one with many different objects and styles which will render dynamically. 

Afreen: Implement breakout patterns for different stages.

Neil: Integrated slider functionality with all other functionalities of a game. Implemented slider size change dynamically as oject hits it and its type.

Rahil: Integrated collision detection component of the game, added limit of powerups per level and new level on completion.
